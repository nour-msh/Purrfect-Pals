> Purrfect Pals application is an app that links pet owners, pet sitters and veterinarians together. Upon clicking on a request sent by the pet owner or the pet sitter, because each pet owner can be a pet sitter and vice versa, users can access eachothers profiles and communicate.
> 
> Users can communicate through a community chat and can find eachother using the google maps feature.
### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to go out without leaving my pet without supervision.
- As a user, I want to be able to find pet owners like me and communicate with them.
- As a user, I want to find veterinarians near by for when my pet is in need of a visit.

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
